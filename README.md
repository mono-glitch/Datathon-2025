(Note: Sensitive/confidential data are removed, only data analytics tools used and model performance results will be displayed.)

- Collaborated within a team of four to develop a Random Forest model in Python using real-world data, achieving over 95% accuracy and 0.98 ROC-AUC score in classifying company hierarchies (Domestic/Global Ultimate)
- Evaluated feature importance and performance trade-offs to calibrate the model for consistent and inclusive classification, resulting a 7% precision-recall gap
